JavaScript Assignment 4  

Read about how a random number can be created in JS: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp.  

Go through the first 5-7 pages of the following tutorial to learn more about SVG: http://www.w3schools.com/svg/  

Clone these codes in GitHub: https://github.com/codingdojoco/js_circle  

NOTE: Because we haven't taught you how to do OOP in Javascript, the codes here may not be most elegant. Just see if you can understand the core concepts presented in the codes and implement the features below.  

Add new codes in circles.html so that wherever you click, it draws a new circle! Take time to understand these codes and play around with SVG as it will help you use some cool JS libraries later.  

See if you can implement any of these changes, but do NOT spend more than 2-3 hours working on these optional features (there are other cooler JS tricks you will learn so we don't want you to spend too much time on this assignment)  

	(optional) See if you can get different colored circles to appear and fade out  

	(optional) See if you can generate tiny circles around the mouse cursor whenever you move the mouse creating something that has the effect of a magic wand with sparkles (see this image)  

	(really optional) Using HTML5, we can see if the user is using a mobile device (iPad, iphone, android phone, etc) and see if the phone is tilted, moving, etc. See if you can have the circles kind of fall towards the direction your phone screen is tilted. Read http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/ for more information.  

think about other cool things you could do with Javascript and SVG. :)
